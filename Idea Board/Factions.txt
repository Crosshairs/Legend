Factions build city: Requires a ton of players to agree and real money
                     City has services (mine, bank, etc)
		     More money paid (monthly) = better city (Also, bigger city and more npcs to run stuff)
		     More money paid also means more room for players

Payment responsibility: Not based on guild leader, there is a donation system for guild
			What happens when payments aren't met?
